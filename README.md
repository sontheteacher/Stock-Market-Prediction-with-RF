# Stock Market Direction Prediction with Random Forest Classifier

I implemented this paper: [Predicting the direction of stock market prices using random forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00003) by Luckyson Khaidem, Snehanshu Saha, Sudeepa Roy Dey.

The paper uses Random Forest Classifier to predict the direction of stock market prices. The features are extracted from historical price and trading volume data. The features are then used to train the Random Forest Classifier to predict the direction of stock market prices.

Here are the results of my implementation.
